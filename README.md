# React Starter

This starter kit is a boilerplate for React and Typescript. The folder `apps` is at the same level as `src`, allowing
multiple front-end apps and their entrypoints to be developed separately from the component library.

Originally forked from a boilerplate by [Codesbiome](https://github.com/codesbiome), this repo has since been extended
with GSAP, Styled-Components and additional configuration.
